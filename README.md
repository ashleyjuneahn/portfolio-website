# Portfolio website

## Project Abstract

This website, coded in HTML and CSS through bootstrap, presents my work in news reporting, opinion writing, and coding. I used this project to expose myself to HTML, CSS, and user interface design while creating a comprehensive portfolio of my journalistic work. This was my first time coding in HTML and CSS, so it was fun learning through trial and error and finally creating the look I wanted.
