# Portfolio website

## Project Abstract

This website, coded in HTML and CSS through bootstrap, presents my work in news reporting, opinion writing, and coding. My goal was to create a visual-first look at my journalistic work, which required research into what HTML elements I would need to make this happen. I had not learned JavaScript at this point, so I relied on CSS to create responsive features such as hovering the mouse over images and text. As this was my first time coding in HTML and CSS, and experimenting with user interface design, it was fun learning through trial and error and finally creating the look I wanted.
